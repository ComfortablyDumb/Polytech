III/ Opinions

Enzo:
I think that the fact that the Japan recognizes the horrors they did during WW2 is very important and so that it is a very good thing that they pay tribute to the victims the attack of Pearl Harbor. In general I think that every countries which did horrors in an other country should pay tribute to the victims and apologize for what they did. The fact that a country do not recognize a massacre in an other country can create political issues between these two countries. For example Japan do not recognize the massacre of Nankin that they also did during WW2 and that something that makes political issues between Japan and China.
